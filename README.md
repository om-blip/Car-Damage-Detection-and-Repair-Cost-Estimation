# 🚗 Car Damage Detection and Repair Cost Estimation

## Overview  
This project leverages **Mask R-CNN** and **Deep Learning** techniques to automate car damage detection and repair cost estimation. Designed for applications in the **automotive industry** (e.g., insurance providers, repair shops), this solution streamlines the claims process, minimizes human error, and enhances customer satisfaction.  

### Key Features  
- **Damage Detection**: High-accuracy car damage detection using Mask R-CNN with ~94% precision.  
- **Repair Cost Estimation**: Predicts repair costs based on detected damage and Intersection-over-Union (IoU) metrics.  
- **Automated Claims Processing**: Streamlines insurance claims by integrating image-based analysis and cost estimation.  
- **Transparency and Efficiency**: Employs color splash visualization for clear identification of damaged areas.
